# BigLetters CLI Program

**BigLetters** is a C-based CLI program that prints large letters and numbers made from Unicode block characters. It includes options for colorizing the output using the standard 16 terminal colors and supports both normal and bold font styles.

## Features

- Generates large letters and numbers using Unicode block characters.
- Supports letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) in uppercase.
- Options for normal and bold font styles.
- Allows color selection from a range of 1 to 15.
- Portable design with a Makefile for easy compilation.
- Includes command-line arguments for automation or scripting use.

## Requirements

- GCC compiler
- `make` utility

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or copy the `bigletters.c`, `Makefile`, and font files into a directory.
2. Compile the program using `make`:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

This will produce an executable named `bigletters` in the directory.

## Usage

Run the program by specifying the text, color code, and an optional bold flag. You can use command-line arguments or interactively enter the text and color.

### Command-Line Arguments

You can pass arguments directly to the program, allowing easy scripting and automation:

```bash
./bigletters -t "HELLO WORLD" -c 4 -b
```

- `-t`: Specifies the text (up to 20 characters, uppercase letters and numbers only).
- `-c`: Sets the color code (1-15).
- `-b`: Optional flag to print in bold style.

### Interactive Mode

If no arguments are provided, youâ€™ll be prompted for input:

```bash
$ ./bigletters
Enter a string (A-Z, 0-9 only, max 20 characters): HELLO
Enter a color (1-15): 3
```

This will print "HELLO" in large, yellow letters.

### Color Codes

| Color Code | Color               |

| 15         | Bright White        |

> **Note:** If an invalid color is specified, the program defaults to white.

## Cleanup

To remove compiled files and generated artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

For a full reset, including configuration files generated by `autoconf`:

```bash
make distclean
```

## Code Structure

- **`bigletters.c`**: Main program file containing logic for processing text and color inputs, along with handling CLI arguments.
- **`bigletters.h`**: Header file with constants, color codes, and function declarations.
- **`font_normal.c`**: Defines standard font patterns for letters and numbers.
- **`font_bold.c`**: Defines bold font patterns for letters and numbers.
- **`Makefile.am`**: Automake configuration for building the project.
